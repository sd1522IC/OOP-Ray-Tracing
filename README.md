This repository implements a optical simulation and ray tracing framework for modeling light propagation through optical systems. The codebase features classes for various optical elements—including spherical refractors, biconvex lenses, and plano convex lenses—that calculate ray intersections, refractions via vectorized Snell’s law, and focal points based on both thin and thick lens equations. It supports the generation of ray bundles with configurable geometries, enabling the evaluation of root mean square (RMS) spot sizes, diffraction scales, and three‐dimensional ray tracks, which are visualized using matplotlib in both 2D and 3D formats. The framework includes an analysis module with a suite of task-specific functions designed to test propagation accuracy, quantify spherical aberrations through curve fitting of delta functions, and assess the impact of beam radii variations on system performance.
